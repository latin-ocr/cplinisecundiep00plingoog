Tanau are already before the-public so many editions
of Selections from Pliny’s Letters that I should not have
ventured, without the invitation of the general editors of

this series, to put forth another. Compliance with their
request, however, has been a labor of love, and 1 trust
it may prove not altogether labor lost.

The publication of the whole of the Lattara, with an
adequate commentary in English, has for sometime seemed
to me every desirable work,-a work which I should like
in future to attempt, should it not‘meantime be undertaken
by one better qualified for the task. Such an edition
should be based upon a new reading of the manuscripts,
as is conspicuously shown by a comparison of Keil's edition
with Professor M'errill's collation of the Codex Riccordicnca
in the American Journal of Philoloqy, for December, 1895.

My obligations, in the preparation of my Introduction
and Notes, have been chiefly to Mommsen’s important
article on the Younger Pliny, in Hermes, III.; to Kraut's
and Lagergren's dissertations on the language and style of
Pliny3 and in a more general sense to the various editors
cited in the list ou page xli of the Introduction and the
Abbreviations on page 128. Indebteduess in detail I have
been careful to achnowledge specifically.

The text is that of Keil, with a few changes.
