Another important contributlon 10 1110 subject is that oi C. Peter
(Zur chronoloyt'e der Bn'efe des jiiayeren Plinius, Philologus, XXXII.
698 sqq.).

Peter 0111101000 Mommsen’s view that it is always true that letters
whose dates can be fixed fit into the chronological order and that the
others are 001 inconsistent with it, and especially the opinion that no
letters were written beiore the death 01 Domitian. He thinks but
little weight is 10 be attached to the 1001 11101 whatever two letters
have a connection the laterone always stands later in the collection,
that letters about the same subject or 01 the same period come in the
same book or in two consecutive books. In the same light he regards

the argument 01 Mommsen about the age 01 1110 correspondents, ob- .

sarving that most correspondents get but a single letter.

Then follow the positive 1010100000 thch Peter drawa. In the letters
01 the 4111 and 5111 books Pliny appears as a poet, and a lyric poet at
that. But in Ep. VIL4 he says that he has nunc primum made an
essay in hendecasyllabics, while in Ep. VIII. 21 he calls the 0011001100
01 1110 poems musteus liber, and ia iip. IX. 34 himseli a 1000110 poeta.
Hence these letters must have been written earlier than those ln books
4 and 5.

lie finds that npp. IV. 3, IV. 18, and V. 15, to Arrius Antonius
010 001 10 1110 right order; also that the same is 110001 Epp. VIII. 1
and IX. 34, andei Epp. II. li, II. 123 compared with Epp. 1114,
III. 9.

With reference 10 1111119110 argues that it disproves the idea
that the letters 01 1110 td book go only to the beginning 01 100, 00
account 01 chronological consideratione, which, he states, render it
impossible that Erucius should have been a candidate 101 1110 tribune-

the 1001 11101 the cese oi Marius (Ep. II. 11) was twice under discus-

on the first occasion was that clvil proceedings should go 00 first, and
meantime codeiendants and witnesses 1011110 criminal proceedings

1. Both Marius Priscus and classicus governed provinces in the

2. Mommsen is obliged to assume that Pliny was praefectus 0010111·
