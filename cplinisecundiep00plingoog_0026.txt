to Trajan expresses gratitudo for the grant of the tusleium
liberemur, the privileges of ‘a father of three children.'¹

He was perhaps unable to remember his father3 at all
events he does not speak of him. Toward his
mother and uncle he was affectionate and duti-
ful.² In this respect his conduct was not exceptional. But
in generosity toward his friends, in liberality toward worthy
objecta, in tireless public spirit, he has few

equale among men known in ancient history. ξὲἶζίῑέἓθι

To quote from Mr. Hardy :³ “At one time he
gives a fellow-tcwnsman 300‚000 sesterces to .
make up the equestrian census3⁴ at another time he oon-
tributed 100,000 towards the weddingdowcr cf a friend's
daughter3⁵ at another he helped Artemidorus the philoso
pher tc satisfy his clamorous creditors.⁶ The poet Martial
received some help towards his journey home to Spain!
Quintilian was presented with a sum cf 50,000 sesterces for
his daughter’s dower‚⁸ while an old nurse was settled com·
fortahly on a little farm which Pliny bought for her.’'⁹
Perhaps itis a stronger evidence cf friendship to bega
favor fora man than to give him money. This
depende upon whether one is more like Dick- gemo„
ens or like Thackeray. Pliny was like both,
and used his influence, as well as his property, without stint
for the good of his friends. We find him asking‚ and oh
taining, for one or another of them, a centurion's commis·
