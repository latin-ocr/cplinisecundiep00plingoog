3. He is therefore obliged to consider Epp. ad Trat8 and 9 as cut ot
the chronological order in which all the other letters oi the group stand

4. In llp. Vl. 29, where Pliny names the five great cases in which
he had been counsel‚ that oi Classicus, with regar'd ιο its second main
discussion, is named before that oi Marius Priscus.

The expression acte memoriam mecm, in Ep. IL 14. 3, aud the
general tone oi that letter mark Pliny as advanced in llic.

Thus Peter goes through the books in order, finding a number oi
letters which seem ιο him inconsistent with the chronological amange-
ment oi Mommsen, his final conclusion being that we cannot accept
Mommsen’s scheme oi arrangement-a purely negative conclusion.

Summing up, our verdict would be as follows ι The scheme arranged
by Mommsen commends itseli in its main features. certain points
may be considered as insufficiently established, but they do not invali-
date the conclusions as a whole. The argument is a constructive one,
ln which the different parts, leading to a common object, have cumu-
lative force. Destructlve argument is relativcly easier. Conclusicns
may be attached, or eveurefuted, and nothing put in their place.
Some oi the obiectione ιο Mommsen’s positione are undoubtedly fanci-
iul or unsound, some may be admitted to be convincing in detail. In
one important particular the case against Mommsen’s view is very
strongly supported; thetis, in the matter oi the date oi the trial oi
Classicus and all that is involved therein. We may modify our
acceptance oi Mommsen’s chronology to the extent oi adopting the
conclusione oi Stobbe and Peterin this respect, while believing rt ιο
be substautially correct as a whole.
