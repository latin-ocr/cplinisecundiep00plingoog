THE cunouomsr OF THE LETTERS

Jou. Messon published at Amste1·dam,in1709,his Plinii Secundi
Iunioris cito ordine chronolooieo sic digesta ot corio dilucidentur
historiae Romanae puncto quoe Flavianos Imperatores reti Nervam
ct Troianum spectant. (Prefixed ιο Arntzen's edition of the Pane·
gyric, Amet. 1738.)

The most important 'contribution in recent times ιο this subject is
Mommsen’s article in Hermes, 111. pp. 31-139‚ Zur Lebensaeschicbte
des jitoocren Plinius.

Mommsen minimizes the significanee cf the phrase in Ep. Ι. 1, nore
servato temporis ordine, and concludes that upon the whole, though
notin every particular, the arrangement of the letters ischronological,
and also that Pliny himself issum all nine books at successive dates.
The latter point may bs inferred not merely from the well known
practice of publishing literary works in instalments‚ but also from
Ep. lx. 19, sipniflms legisse te ire quodam epistola mec, referring ιο
Ep. VI. 10, and from Ep. VII. 28, addressed to the same person
as Ep. 1. l, justifyiug the author‘s praising of his friends. Mommsen
argues that letters on the same subject, or otherwise evidently synchro-
nous, are found in the same book or in consecutive books, and con-
versely that two certainly synchronous letters are never far separated,
and that oi a pair of letters the laterone never eomes first in the col·
lection. A similar chronological order is traced in the references ιο
certain persons, e.g., M. Regulus aud Calestrius Tiro, in the references
ιο Pliny’s marriages and ιο the relatives of his wives, A gradual'
change is observed in the list of Pliny’s correspondents, older meu
appearing in the earlier books,.y0uuger in the later ones, while men
of the author's own ege appear all through the collection.
