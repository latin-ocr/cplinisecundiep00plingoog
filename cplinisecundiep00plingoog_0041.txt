57. Tarans

a. The epistolary tenses are seldom used. This is because
the letters are such rather in form than in essence. The
epistolary use is most frequent in the letters to Trajan.
There is an extensive use cf the historica] present, and
some instances of the present indicative for the future in
protasis.

, Upon the whole, Pliny's use of the tenses cannot be con-
sidered as far from normal.

58. Moons “

α. ΤΙιθ subjunctive of iteration or generalization in rela
tivc sentences:

quocunque me contulissent, vr. 10. 2.

quotiens . . . intraret, 111.16.4.

. b. The subjunctive often follows qcamqucm. Kraut,
§ 39, says there are ten¹ such cases.

c. st modo regularly takes the indicative unless oratio
obliqua requires the subjunctive.

d. Quamuis with the subjunctive is used of facts, not
merely of argumentative concessions.

e. substantive clauses, the objects of verbs of oskiuy,
admoniabiay, biddc'ny, and the like, are often used without
at; e.g.‚ after royarc, orare, petere, postulare, bertolt, crecere,
censere, optare, curare. Of the thirty instances after roycre,
twenty are without at.

Iubere takes this construction, instead of the infinitive.

In rx. 33. 11 occurs the unique instance of the subjunctive
without at after opus est. ι
