senens smne xxxvii

ir. Ellipsis. In the extent of his use of this figure
Pliny hardly exoeeds Cicero (in his letters) and Tacitus.

1. The most common form is the omission of forms
of the verb ‘to be' Pliny is peculiar in not eon·
fining ellipsis to esi, mm, and esse, but in extending
it to other moeris, other tenses, and other persons.

2. His omission of verba dicendi, movendi, maadi,
oto, is not peculias. It tends to brevity‚ and
they are easily supplieei

3. Sometimes there is a continuans ¹effort to secure
brevity. An example of this is the whole of Ep. 1.5.

i. Similes are frequent.

j. Conoinnity is elaborate, antithesis is constantly aimed
at

ic. Oxymoron:

morti . . . immortalem aleriam, v1. 16. 1.
semper victurus occiderit, v1. 16. 2.
peremiaaiio inter sua, 111. 19. 4.

i. Assonanoe:

secere scribenda aut seribere leaenae, vn 16. 3.

m. Repetition of a word with ohange of form:

’ ratio rationem . . . timorem timor, vx. 16. 16.
ire exsilium exsilii eausam, vn. 19. 6.

a. Repetition of a word in the same form:

de rita eius . . . <ie rita paeri, iv. 7. 2.
ire praefectura . . . suit, soit et ire consolata, v. 14. 5.

But there is evident oare not to repeat a word too often
in quiet suoeession. Note, for instance, in Ep. 11. 17. 5
and 6, the variety of words ior ‘prospect'
