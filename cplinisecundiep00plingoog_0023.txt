tion as an advocate. His earlier practice seems to have
been mainly in the court of the centumviri}
fflccsnffitffl This tribunal was a very ancient one, the his·

tory of which is but imperfectly known. It

was permanent, but its members were probably chosen
annually from the tribes. The name was correct enough so

it was retained aiter the number was raised to 180. They
sat in the Basilica dulia, with a spear (tosta), the ancient

symbolos Quiritary ownership‚ planted before them. The
court was divided into four chamhms, which usually sat
separately. But for cases of special importance they were
combined, sometimes in one body (quadruplex iudicium),
sometimes in two sections (duplos iudicium duce Ιιαθκαιε).2
Cicero enumerates⁸ the kinds of causes referred to this
court, wia, disputes as to Quiritary ownership‚ including
‘servitutes’ wills, intestato succession, guardianship, and
questions of statue, involving freedom or citizenship. In
Pliny's time it was doubtless concerned chiefly, if not en-

anecdotes about it and familiar allusions to it.l
