LATIN

The Latin Language

A Historical Outline 'of its Sounds‚ Inflections, and Syntax, by

CRARLFS E. ΒΕΝΝΕΤΓ, Goldwin Smith Professor of Latin in Cornell

University. 12mo, eloth, 272 peges. Price,31.00.

HIS is a text-book in advanced Latin Grammar for colleges

and universities. lt is a complete revision of the Appendix
to Bennett's Latin Grammar‚ a book which was first prepared in
1896, from a series of lectures to advauced students on subjects
not covered by any Latin Grammar published in America. The
title, Appendix‚ was found to be misleading, and the author has
given to the revision the new name of The Latin lauguage. The
book gives such information regarding the history aud develop-
ment of the language as experience has shown to be of service
to students who are specializing in Latin.

The subjects treated are: The Latin Alphabet, liccem, lnflec-

tions Pronunciation‚ Orthography, Adverbs and Prepositions,
Hiddeu Quantity, The latin Sounds‚ and Syntax.

Syntex of Early Latin

By Professor CHARLus E. ΒΕΝΝΕἸῪ, of Cornell University.

v01. 1: The Verb. 8νο, eloth, 525 pages. Prioe, 8400.

Vol. 11: The case constructione. avo, eloth, 419 peges. Price, 5400.

HIS book is intended to replace the now long antiquated

manual of Holtze, Syntam's Priscorum Scriptorum Latino-
rum, Leipsic, 1861-62. Since that work was published our texts
of all the liarly Latin writers have been put upon a new founda-
ti0n3 new principles and standards have been set up in syntac-
tioel investigation; and scores of 'important monographs have
appeared on the syntax of special authors and of special usages.
The author's aim has been to incorporate in his work the results
of all these labors. The book, while dealing primarily with the
syntax of Early Latin, is of fundamental importanee to every
earnest student of the syntax of the later classica] period, since
Early Latin so often reveals the germ from which the classica!
idiom has developed.
