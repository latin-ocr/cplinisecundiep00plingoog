b. Parenthesis: fortyone cases have been counted irr the
first four books.

c. Asyndeton both of words and sentences is frequent.

of sentences: in rapid narrative with much detai13 e.g.,

1. 53 11. 10 (seven sentences); rr. 18. 2.

Of words: the three-membered asyndeton is developed
into a decided mannerism, about one hundred instances
ψ being counted in the letters arrd about thirty in the
panegyrim 0⁸& vrr. 33. 10.

It often leads to an excessive multiplicatiori of words.

There are about forty cases of asyndeton of two members,
and about twenty with more than three members.

d. Polysyndeton is comparatively infrequent3 about
thirty instances are counted.

e. Anaphora is very characteristic of such a rhetorical
style as Pliny's, and was in general strongly developed in
the Silver Age. Pliny uses it even in simple passages of
quiet description, but in the Panegyric there are said to be
thirty-six cases in the first fifteen chapters, and seven in
the thirty-fourth chapter alone.

- s. Hendiadys; perhaps but one instance:

riooitoteor odoremque, rx. 33. 9.

Α sort of verbal hendiadys is illustrated in

componere et eracapere, v. 1. 7.

9. Aposiopesis:

Interim Miseni eqo et morer . . ., vr. 16. 21.
