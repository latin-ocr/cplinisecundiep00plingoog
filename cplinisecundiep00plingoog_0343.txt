HIS book is divided into three Pam, each of which provides
material sor a onehour course throughout the year. The
exercises are based upon passages oi Caesar and Cicero, un·
familiar to students in the early part ol their college course.
Parts 1 and ll are designed specially for ireshman work.
They both cover practically the same ground, thus making it
possible to use the book in two successive years without giving
the same exercise twice. ln preparing the passages for transla-
tion into latin tuo ends have been kept in view: first, to test
the knowledge ot' forms and syntax at the plaoes where experi-
ence has shown the freshman student to be weak; and, second,
to illustrate a few ot' the fine points which cannot be adeqmtely
treated in the preparatory school.
Part 111 provides suitable work for students who have oom-
pleted either Part 1 or Part 11. ln it the exerrises are longer
aud more diffimlt, and the notes afford the student lens assistance
