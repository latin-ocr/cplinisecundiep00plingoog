Young Pliny was so fortunate, moreover, as to have for his
guardian¹ no less a man than Verginius Rufus,
whose importante is sufficiently indicated by the ἕψω
fact that he thrice refused the imperial purple.

With two such sponsors, it is not surprising that our
Pliny's career in politica, at the ber, and in literature should
have begun early. llis own ability, reinforced by hard
work, enabled him to grasp the success which rare social
and educatione] advantages put within his reaoh.

Great pains were taken with his bringing up. The condi-
tione of life among the Romans were then such
that almost the only way to practical success
was the career of the orator. Hence the education of a
gentleman was intended to train him to be an effective public

speaker, and ‘rhetoric' was synonymous with a liberal edu·
cation, general as well es special. Cato's definition,—

Orator est vir honus dicendi peritus‚²

well expressed the Roman ideal of an earlier age. The
most complete exposition of the system of education in
wogue in the first century is found in the great work of
Quintilian, the Institutio Oratorie. Quintilian was one of
Pliny’s toachers³-that schoolmaster who be·
came consul, and whose career shows the esteem
in which ‘rhetoric’ then stood. Another was the celebrated
Nicetes Sacerdos from Smyrna.⁴

It may have been at this period thet Pliny's lifelong
friendship with Tacitus began. The only event in this early
part of his life of which we have detailed knowledge is the
memorable eruption of Vesuvius in 79 an, when
he was in his eighteenth year. The story is
told in two letters to Tacitus.⁵ One of them
