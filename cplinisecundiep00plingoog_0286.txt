made. Massawas a notorious favorite oi Domitian. Note the new
sense oi impietas, disloyalty to the person oi the emperor, acquired

2. clarissimi: this adjective was becoming stereotyped; in the
later empire, it is the technical designation of a certain class in the

already cited. Pliny is a smaller man than his exemplar, even in
vanity. ·
