positions open to consulare alone.1 By way of preliminary
qualifications, the young aspirant to the armaturarum
was required to fill one of the minor annual magistraciea'
collectively called the Vigintivirate‚² and to serve at least a
nominal term in the army as tribuatis militam laticlauios,
ostensibly as cide on the staff of some governor of aprovince
who commanded troops. Hence we often hear of the macec-
stris militia of a tabanus bonores petitoria. Pliny was Xvir '
stlitibus iudicandis³ in 81 or 82. His military tribuneship
was spent in Syria⁴ where he was attached to the third
legion, ‘ Gallica’ and employed in clerieal work connected
with the accounts of the army! Atthis time he must have
been twenty or a little older. After returning to Rome, he
obtained the quaestorship, the lowest senatorial
office. As the minimum age for this was twenty·
five,⁶ he cannot have held it before 87. It seems most
probahle that his term was from J uly 1, 89, to June 30, 90.
The fact that he was quaestor (laeseris indicates that he was
in high favor with the emperor Domitian at this time. The
lea abaelis, which fixed the age at which each office might
be held, also required an interval of at least a year between
the first and second, and between the second and third,
and of two years between the third and fourth offices. We
know that Pliny was praetor in 93! Meantime
he had been tribune of the plebs,⁸ probably from
