2. meatus animae: respiratiors. amplitudinem: full habit.
All thie is an extremely elegant way oi saying that he snored
abominably-a iailing oi many excellent people.

4. diaeta: apartmect; he was probably sleeping in a large airy
raom, larger than the ordinary cubiculum. It may heve been in a
separate vving oi the house, or even a summer house beyond a court·
yard (area).

6. negaretur: would haue been impossible (had he lingered longer
there). We should have expected the pluperiect subjunctive. This
is not merely a consecutive clause, but the apodoeis oi a conditional
sentence (contrary to isat). The imperfect tense gives greater vivid-
ness to the expression, on the principle oi repraesentatio.

12. quemquem: to be connected with the adjectives‚ not with
the verb.

13. quod . . . elegit: comparlsou os dacpcrs led to a choico os

pharis.

26. clausoque stomacho . . . angustus . . . aestuans: clownp
the wiudpipe‚ which irs his case was subject to chronic weelnere,
marrow, auri osten inflamari. There is an apparent confusion between
the windpipe and the oesophagus, the latter being properly desig-
nated by stomacho. But vve must not be too severe upon Pliny's
anatomy and physiology. He mede no protensione to scientiflo
knowledge.

29. tertius: i.e.‚ he arrived on the sith, died on the teth, was
iound on tbe actu August3 his ‘tuosissimus dies' was the day before
hedied.
