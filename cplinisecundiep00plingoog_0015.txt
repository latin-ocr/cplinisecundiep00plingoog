iactory picture we have 01 the imperial ege 01 Rome, at the
beginning 01 the second century, when the empire was in
its prime. Taking 011 110 100110 and limitatione into ac·
count, it was still a great age, worthy 01 11ιο canvas 01 00
artist. The character 01 the 1001 generation 01 the repub
lio had been largely determined by Cicero’s intellectual
activity. Pliny was 00 epochmaker, but he attained a
rare success in portraying for the world 01 after times the
happier, more cheerful, and more virtuous aspects 01 the

age in which he lived. Juvenal and Tacitus
cmmt‘d his contemporaries, were vastly superior to him
mm? in genius, but they were both pessimistic in

tone; the grim narrative 01 the historian is 00
even more terrific indiotment of the age than the diatribae
01 the satirist Their pictures are all shadows. Pliny's
are brighton, and we cannot escape the conviction that they
are truer for the average 01 1110.

Pliny's career was peaceful, busy, prosperous. He was
favored by his circumstances, but his industry fairly earned
the success which so richly rewarded it.

Born in 62 nn, 01 the Cisalpine town 01 Comum, 00 11ιο

reign 01 Vespasian; his young manhood 01 active participa

positione 01 trust, and in somewhat intimate relations with
the great emperor Trajan. He lived under nine emperors.
His father was L. Caecilius Cilo: he was probably the
