Boox VIII.

Ep. 23 cannot have been written before 108 or 109 11 Avitus le the
one mentioned 111 the testament of Dasumius.

Boon IX.

This is the pcorest oi all in dates. Possibly VIII. and IX. were
18811811 together; all we can be sure oi 18 that they were not issued
before 108 or 109. ’

Tur connrssosnewon wrrs Tnsrnn is independent oi the chlef
collection, which never had more than 111118 books.

app. 1 and 2 come at the begInnIng of lhajan's reign.

Epp. 3-11 iall in the period before Pliny‘s legatio in Bithynia.

Epp. 15-121a11 concern that leontio, so iar as they admit any in-
ierence us to date, place, and cIrcumstanoe. liew oi them can have
been written anywhere else.

· Mommsen poInts out the important datum ior this series. Pliny
mentIons several times a Calpurnius Macer, a contemporary governor,
his nearest neighbor, a commender oi legi0ns. 1118 produce must
have been Lower Moesia (0. 1. L. III. 777). consideration oi this and
other known tacte leads Mommsen to date the legatio from 111,
September, to 113, J anuary.

Mommsen‘s chronology oi Pliny’s liieis followed In the biographical
portion oi the Introduction.

H. F. Stobbe (Zur Chroaoloyic der Briese des Plinius, Philologus,
XXX. 347-393) embodies the results oi his own investigation, which
was independent oi Mommsen’s. The concludens which he reaches
are somewhnt different

His discussion involves many oi the same points as that oi Peter
(see below), and his objections are mainly dIrected against Mommsen’s
datIng oi the proceedings agaInst Classicus in 101. He thinks that
PIIny undertoolr the case in the autumn oi 09, while that oi Priscus
was still pendIng. Ii this was so, it would not be necessary to assume,
ae Mommsen does, that the 8th and ath letters in the correspondence
with Trajan are ont oi place 111 the group 3-11, where all the others
are 111 strict order oi time.

The prIncipal distInctive feature oi Stobbe‘s dIssertatIon isan
elaborate consideration ci the times and distances Involved in the
correspondente supposed to have been carried on, by means of the
state courlers, between Pliny in Italy and Trajan in Parmonia, in
the summer oi 99.
