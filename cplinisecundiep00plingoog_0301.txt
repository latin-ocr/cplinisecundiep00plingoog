. Poppaea, sm. 9). Hardy’s note gives a convenient enumeration oi
the privileges attached to the ius triam liberorum: (l) inheritance oi
legacies leit to caelibes, which the latter were forbidden tc take (cc-
ducc); (2) preference repetendis honoribus ,· (3) holding offices before
the legal age or without the legal interval; (4) preference in the
assignment 0f provinces ; (ὃ) precedence before equals and colleagues;
(6) exemption from the duties oi tutor and iudex,· (7) mitigation oi
punishment in certain cases. Wise emperors granted the ica trium
liberorum sparingly‚ others more freely, to childless persons. The
grant was strictly personui, and did not benedt the heirs of the persons
concemed‚ nor was itin any way assignable.

10. Iull Serviani: brother-in-law oi Hadrian, born about 1.».47.
He held many important official positions, and was one of the persons
mentioned in the will of Dasumius, already referred to; see intro-
ductory note to Ep. Il. 6. For details, see Mommsen in Keil‘s Pliny.
At the time of this letter he was legate oi Upper Germany. Pliny
addressed him in Epp. ΙΙΙ. 17 and v1. 26.

advice.

4. peculiarem: personat.

⁵. illo tristissimo saeculo: Domitian’s reign.

6. duobus matrimoniis: this evidently means two marriages in
Domitian’s reign. On the other hand, the letters about Calpurnia
seem to referto a recent marriage, and are evidently to be dated well
on in Trajan’s reign. Hence we infer that Calpurnia was the third
wife of Pliny ; see Introduction, page xviii.

8. patrem fleri: i.e., obtain the privileges oi a father, become a
pater in the eye oi the law. With the general sentiment of this sen·
tenca, cf. Pancp. 26, Super omnic eat tumea quod talia castancto
liberos tollere libeat, expediat.

Pliuy's province, Pontus and Bithynia; see Introduction, page xviii.

11. socnrl meae: Pompeia Celerina, mother of Pliny‘s second
wife, who had died iu nn. 97, as we may infer with strong probability
from Ep. IX. 13. 4 and 13. Concerning Pompeia, see Epp. 1. 43 IIL
19. 8 ; Vl.10.1; and notes.

12. ln banc provinciam: Bithynia
