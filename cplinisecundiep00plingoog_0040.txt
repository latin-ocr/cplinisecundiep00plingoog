q. In double questions the first interrogative particle is
usually omitted:

Italicus ee aa provincialia? rx. 28. 2.

b. Aa implying au impossible alternative is used as in
the Latin of the Golden Age:

Aa aon videtur, 111. 7. 11.
Aa eqo . . . dubitem, ιν. 17. 2.

i. Nescio uc sometimes amounts to amild negative; eg„

111.1.1; ruf. 1,

which is far from the strictly classica] usage. But it also
occurs in the sense of a mild affirmative, or inclining in
that direction3 eg„ ¹ 15 3

j. Quamquam as an adverb occurs frequently with adjec-
tives‚ participles, and adverbs.

The coordinate quamquem (mamaeam, ‘ and yet ’) is said
to occur twentyone times; it is followed by the indicative
and in oratio obliquo by the infinitivo.

§ 6. Goururrcrrous

a. Etiam is relatively frequent. It is often combined
with asyndeton of three or more members3 e.g.,

1. 9. 12 (3 members).
1. 22. 7 (4 members).

This is so frequent as to constitute a marked mannerism.

b. Etutam in the sense of ‘yes‚' ‘to be sure'; eg„
rr. 13. 33 vr. 2, 8.

c. The author is extremely fond of oerum etium (for aed ,
