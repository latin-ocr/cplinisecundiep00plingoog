writer of his generation, but also a conscientious and ener·
getic official. Vespasian, rough soldier though he was, besides
beingasagaciouspractical ruler, had the good sensctoencour-
age literature. Among all his subordinates none was more
trusted than the Elder Pliny, who, in 77 an, dedicated his
encyclopaedic ‘Natural History' to Vespasian's son Titus.
Doubtless the circumstance that Pliny was brought up by
this uncle rather than by his father had an influence upon ‘
his after career. The uncle was a prodigy of industry, as
we learn from a letter¹ of the nephew, describing his habits
of study, which were such that in comparison the nephew,
who to us seems painfully studious‚ might well call himself

a mere idler. Yet the boy was distressingly

the will of Julius Caesar, became O. Julius caesar Octavianus. But
great irregularity in the matter oi proper names had grown up aiter
the decay oi the old pentes and of the petria potestas, so that we have
no reason to be surprised at the iorm oi our author’s name, assumed
