not a case 01 haphazard survival, nor yet 01 posthumous
editing by a stranger. We have the satisfaction 01 knowing
that the collection contains just what the writer intended
it should. We are not troubled with misgivings, therefore,
in forming our estimato 01 him. As he tells his own story,
we may take him at his word It is eminently fitting that
euch a man, and the representative 01 such an age, should
appear before the world in a literary toilet 1111160616-
fully arranged. Letters which showed him en
cessaturam 10 speak, or betrayed him at an
unguarded moment, when he forgot his pose, if 116 ever had
such a moment, would be out 01 keeping. Pliny in a state
01 nature would not be the real Pliny. He 16 least artificial
iu the letters 10 Trajan, but he 16 not there at his best.
We appreciate his abilities and his conscientious endeavors

doubt he was proud to be trusted, but the position clearly ⁸
worried him, and in 1116 heart he pined 101 the brilliant
society 01 Rome or the calm literary reposo 01 his villas.

Pliny's chief excellence as a writer is his 0100111066, and ⁰
the 011161 6161116111 01 his charm is 1116 modemaess, 01 thought ι

and expression One evidence 01 this is the

singular felicity 01 Melmoth's translation in 3⁰:¹33&
‘ Johpscnese! Warton said 01 this version that

it bettered the original. While we might not be willing to
go 60 161 66 that, we do 1661 that the extraordinary appro

kindred spirit with the English authors 01 that time.

To sum up our impressione-Pliny is the most amiable

able in all private relations, but nothing unkind
is said by him 01 any contemporaries while they live, except
01 Regulus and other equally infamous representatives 01
