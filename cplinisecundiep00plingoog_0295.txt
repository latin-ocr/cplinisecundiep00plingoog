Pege 113. ³. Reprehendis, eta: this discussion whether Ver-
ginius by his epitaph, or Frontinus by his refusal to have one, showed
the more pride, is a good example oi the academie character oi the
literature oi the time. This letter does not even pretend to convey
any information except an answer to a real or supposed question oi
Ruso, which sounds like a question proposed ior a debating society.
