uneship and praetorship had been remitted by Domitian.1
He explains in Ep. 1231110 in Panegyric 95 his reasons for
refraining from practice as an advocate during the year 01
his tribuneship. He claime credit also ior modestia during
his praetorship. Certainly such conduct was prudent. That
it was not saie, iu 93, to make one’s seli conspicuous in
any way is evident 110111 Tacitus's account 01 the death 01
Agricola² in that year. Pliny was so discreet that he was,

as lateas 94 01 95, appointed praefectus cerarii
⁰⁰¹¹¹¹²¹i⁸ff¹9¹²⁸¹ militaris, an office which he held for three
ἓξὲξ muitary years. Nevertheless, it appeared from papers

found in Domitian’s desk, aiter his murder,
that Pliny would, in all probability, soon have been added
to the list of the tyrant's victims³ Fortunately, however, he
was allowed to live on into the better times of Nerva and
TraJ‘an. Yet his advancement, which had been steady and

rapid, partly perhaps owing to the support 01
⁰f⁰¹¹¹¹¹¹i⁸⁸¹⁰¹²⁰¹ Verginius Rufus,⁴was arrested for the remaiuder
{nixum 01 Domitian's reign. By Nerva he was made

praefectus 0010111 Saturni, commissioner 01 the
Treasury,with hisoldiriendtlornutusTertullusforcelleague.⁵
It was not till September, 100, that he attained the consul-
ship, which 110 held 101 that mouth and October,
again with Cornutus for his oolleague. Upon
taking office, he delivered in the senate the oration 01 thanks
101 his nomination by the emperor Trajan, which, revised

consul

under the name 01 the Panegyrie. This is a

very valuable historioal document, as it is the only authority

⁴ Ep. 11. 1. 8 ; Pliny gratefully acknowledges this support.

ὅΜο1111110011, Hermes Ill. pages 89-91, gives reasons for supposing
that Pliny held this office four years, 98-101. But see Appendix Ι.
